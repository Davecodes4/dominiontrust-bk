# Email Notifications Added to Banking Operations

## Summary

I've added email notification functionality to all the major banking operations that were missing notifications. Here's what was added:

## Functions Updated with Email Notifications:

### 1. `transfer_funds()` - Internal Transfers
- **Notification Type:** `transfer_sent`

  - User name, transaction ID, amount, currency
  - Description, date, account number (last 4 digits)
  - Transaction reference, recipient name

### 2. `deposit_funds()` - User Deposits
- **Notification Type:** `deposit_received`
- **Context Data:**
  - User name, transaction ID, amount, currency
  - Description, date, account number (last 4 digits)
  - Transaction reference, new account balance

### 3. `withdraw_funds()` - User Withdrawals
- **Notification Type:** `withdrawal_completed`
- **Context Data:**
  - User name, transaction ID, amount, currency
  - Description, date, account number (last 4 digits)
  - Transaction reference, new account balance

### 4. `external_transfer()` - External Bank Transfers

  - Description, date, account number (last 4 digits)

  - Description, date, account number (last 4 digits)
  - Transaction reference, new balance, admin note
- **Note:** Only sends notification if auto_approve=True

### 6. `create()` in CardListView - Card Creation
- **Notification Type:** `card_created`
- **Context Data:**
  - User name, transaction ID for fee, card type and brand
  - Masked card number, fee amount, currency
  - Date, account number, transaction reference
  - Remaining account balance

## Implementation Details:

### Notification Pattern Used:
```python
def send_notification_after_commit():
    try:
        from notifications.services import NotificationService
        notification_service = NotificationService()
        notification_service.send_notification(
            user=request.user,
            notification_type='transaction',
            template_type='[template_name]',
            context_data={
                # Template-specific data
            }
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"WARNING: Failed to send notification: {e}")

# Use transaction.on_commit to ensure notification is sent only after successful DB commit
transaction.on_commit(send_notification_after_commit)
```

### Key Features:
1. **Safe Failure:** Notifications don't cause transaction failures if they fail to send
2. **Database Consistency:** Uses `transaction.on_commit()` to ensure notifications only send after successful database commits
3. **Rich Context:** Each notification includes relevant transaction details
4. **User-Friendly Data:** Includes formatted dates, masked account numbers, and descriptive text

## Template Types Required:

The notification system will need these email template types:
- `transfer_sent` - For outgoing transfers (internal and external)
- `deposit_received` - For deposits (user and admin)
- `withdrawal_completed` - For withdrawals
- `card_created` - For new card creation with fee charges

## Result:

Now all major banking operations will send email notifications to users:
- ✅ Internal transfers between accounts
- ✅ External transfers to other banks
- ✅ Deposits (user-initiated and admin)
- ✅ Withdrawals
- ✅ Card creation with fee charging
- ✅ Transfer with PIN verification (already had notifications)

This ensures users receive timely email notifications for all their banking activities, improving the user experience and providing proper transaction confirmations.
