## 📊 **Real Examples**

### **Christmas Week 2024 Scenario**
```
Dec 23 (Mon) → Next business day: Dec 24 (Tue)
Dec 24 (Tue) → Next business day: Dec 26 (Thu) [skips Christmas]
Dec 25 (Wed) → Next business day: Dec 26 (Thu) [Christmas Day]
```

### **July 4th Week Scenario**
```
July 3 (Wed) → 1 business day = July 5 (Fri) [skips July 4th]
July 3 (Wed) → 2 business days = July 8 (Mon) [skips weekend too]
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Functions**
```python
# Check if date is a business day
is_business_day(date) → True/False

# Get next business day (skips weekends + holidays)
get_next_business_day(start_date, days_ahead) → date

# Get holiday information
get_holiday_info(date) → (is_holiday, holiday_name)

# Count business days between dates  
calculate_business_days_between(start, end) → int
```

### **Enhanced Transaction Methods**
```python
# Holiday-aware completion messages
transaction.get_estimated_completion_message()
# → "Your transfer is on the way... (excluding Christmas Day)"

# Holiday impact notifications
transaction.get_holiday_impact_message()
# → "Note: Independence Day may affect processing times"
```
